## Summary

**Phase 32: Extend projection to 3 years** ✅

Modified `src/lib/calculateProjection.ts`:
- Extended `calculateProjection()` to generate projections for 2026, 2027, and 2028
- Called `projectYear()` three times (once per year) instead of just once
- Replaced placeholders for 2027 and 2028 with actual projections
- Since DRIP is not yet implemented, each year produces identical dividend amounts

Changes:
- Updated function comment to reflect 3-year projection
- Generated `year2027` and `year2028` using the existing `projectYear()` helper
- Tests pass, linting clean, formatting verified

Committed with message: "feat: Extend projection to 3 years"

2. **Chronological processing** - Created `DividendEvent` structure and sorted all dividend events by date (month, then day) to process them in the correct order
3. **DRIP calculation** - After each dividend payment:
   - Calculate dividend amount using current share count
   - Divide dividend by current stock price to get new shares
   - Update share tracker with increased share count
4. **Compounding effect** - Share tracker persists across years (2026→2027→2028), creating true compounding

**Key implementation details:**
- Uses `currentShares` from tracker instead of `initialShares`
- Sorts events to ensure proper chronological reinvestment
- DRIP formula: `newShares = dividendAmount / currentPrice`
- Share count grows throughout projection period

All linting and formatting checks passed. Committed with message: "feat: Implement DRIP reinvestment calculation"

Excellent! **Phase 56 complete**. 

## Summary

Phase 56: API route integration test - ✅ Complete

Created comprehensive integration tests at `/tests/integration/api-analyze.test.ts`:

**Tests implemented (10 total, all passing):**
- Full data pipeline: CSV parsing → dividend fetching → projection
- Stocks with/without dividend history
- Failed ticker lookups (error handling)
- FUND-type filtering
- Missing required columns validation
- Empty/invalid CSV data handling
- Network error handling for dividend fetching
- Multi-currency support
- DRIP calculations across 3 years
- Data flow correctness validation

**Approach:**
- Tests validate integration of `parseCsv`, `fetchBatchDividends`, and `calculateProjection` functions
- Avoids testing Next.js route handler directly due to File/Blob mocking limitations in Vitest
- Full HTTP flow covered by upcoming Playwright E2E tests (Phases 57-59)
